                    <h1>About Me</h1>

                    <p>My name is Marcus Crowe, and I am a first-year student studying Computer Information Systems and Technology at the University
                    of Pittsburgh at Bradford. I am from a very small town, Johnsonburg, PA. I graduated with only 49 classmates, and it was
                    still one of largest classes in years. I was drawn to the campus for many reasons!
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's close to home (45 minutes)</li>
                        <li>It's much cheaper than other schools</li>
                        <li>It's small and personal, you get lots of interaction with faculty</li>
                        <li>I enjoy the area</li>
                        <li>I can visit my friends and family each weekend</li>
                        <li>+ much more</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Feel free to explore my website and see what is has to offer! Each page includes a few links to my personal social
                      platforms, a quick home button that will return you to the top of the page, and more! Experiment with different browser sizes, 
                      and see what changes on certain pages. Thanks for looking!

                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <p>I am very interested in cars, computers, and learning. I have been into cars ever since I got my first
                        car, when I was 16. Computers have been my passion since I was about 6 years old, I was introduced
                        very early due to having expertise in the family. Professionally-wise, I am mostly interested in Networking,
                        and Systems Management positions. I am also extremely interested in AI and machiene/deep learning. Web and graphic
                        design are more of a passion of mine, I would primarily like to focus on one of the above as a full-time career.
